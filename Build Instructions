Scalping Bot Android App Specifications
App Name: NeoScalp
(Chosen for its sci-fi, Matrix-inspired vibe—evoking "Neo" from The Matrix for the cyberpunk hacker feel, combined with "scalp" for day trading precision. The name implies a futuristic, intelligent trading agent.)
1. Overview

App Purpose: A modern, sci-fi themed Android app for automated and semi-automated scalping in stocks using Alpaca API. It streams live prices via WebSocket, displays a live candle chart with technical indicators (EMA, VWAP, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and Stochastic Oscillator) for smart entry/exit decisions, and supports both long (buy low/sell high) and short (sell high/buy low) trades. The bot dynamically switches between long/short modes based on market trend detection (e.g., via EMA crossovers or VWAP slope). Users can adjust symbols, parameters, and toggle between paper/live modes. It runs as a foreground service for uninterrupted background operation, with pull-down notification snippets for key info. The app emphasizes user control with adjustable parameters in 0.1 increments for fine-tuning entry/exit rules to make them more lax or restrictive. Add risk management features like max risk per trade (default 1% of equity) and daily loss limits to prevent blow-ups. Include a dashboard for real-time P&L tracking and historical performance reports.
Target Audience: Personal use for day traders; no multi-user features.
Core Philosophy: The bot makes "smart" decisions using indicators to gauge momentum, overbought/oversold conditions, and trend strength. Entries are based on confluence (e.g., EMA crossover + RSI <30 for longs), exits on targets or reversals. Always prioritize safety with confirmations for live trades.
Additional Important Features to Add:
Backtesting Mode: A simulation tab to test strategies on historical data (pulled via Alpaca API) before going live.
Voice Alerts: Optional text-to-speech for signals (e.g., "Entry signal on JNJ").
Battery Optimization: Detect and prompt for ignoring battery optimization to ensure foreground service reliability.
Error Logging: Auto-save logs to a file for debugging; include a "Report Bug" button that emails logs.
Offline Mode Fallback: If disconnected, show last known data and attempt auto-reconnect every 10 seconds.
Data Export: Export trade history as CSV for tax/analysis.
Legal Disclaimer: On first launch and before any trade, show a popup: "Trading involves significant risk of loss. This app is for educational purposes; consult a professional. Not financial advice."

3. App Structure and Screens
Use Compose Navigation for seamless routing. Bottom navigation bar with neon-glowing icons (cyberpunk style: green matrix code on black background, glitch animations on taps). Overall theme: Dark mode default with cyberpunk aesthetics—neon greens/blues, matrix rain effects on splash, holographic button hovers, glitch transitions between screens.

Splash Screen: Matrix-style code rain animation (Lottie) with app logo "NeoScalp" emerging. Transitions to onboarding if first launch (key input + disclaimer).
Home/Dashboard Screen:
Top: Live price ticker (streaming via WebSocket, with glitchy update animation—green if up, red if down).
Middle: Live 5-minute candle chart (OHLC bars) with overlaid indicators (EMA 9/21, VWAP, RSI 14, MACD 12/26/9, Bollinger Bands 20/2, Stochastic 14/3/3). Chart auto-zooms to last 1-2 hours; pinch-zoom enabled. Highlight entry/exit signals with neon arrows.
Bottom: Status bar showing current mode (Long/Short), P&L, equity. Buttons: "Start Bot" (green neon pulse), "Stop Bot" (red glitch).
Pull-to-refresh for reconnecting WebSocket.

Symbols Tab:
Editable field to input/change symbol (e.g., JNJ, WMT). Auto-validate via Alpaca API (/v2/assets). Watchlist for up to 5 symbols with quick-switch tabs.

Parameters Tab:
Sliders/spinners for adjustments in 0.1 increments (e.g., EMA periods: 9.0-21.0 by 0.1; RSI threshold: 30.0-70.0 by 0.1; Target %: 0.3-1.0 by 0.1; Stop %: 0.2-0.5 by 0.1; Max risk %: 0.5-2.0 by 0.1).

List of trades with details (entry/exit, P&L, indicators at time). Export as CSV.


4. Core Functionality Details

Alpaca Integration:
WebSocket Streaming: Connect to wss://stream.data.alpaca.markets/v2/sip (auth with keys). Subscribe to trades/quotes/bars for the symbol. Update live price and 5-min candles every tick. Handle reconnects automatically.
REST API: Retrofit for orders (/v2/orders), account info (/v2/account), positions (/v2/positions). Support market/limit orders.
Paper/Live Swap: Toggle changes base URL; default to paper.

Scalping Bot Logic:
Mode Switching: Auto-detect market nature: Long if EMA9 > EMA21 and VWAP sloping up; Short if EMA9 < EMA21 and VWAP sloping down. Manual override toggle.
Entry Rules (Smart Gauging): Require confluence (e.g., for long: RSI <30 + Stochastic oversold + price above VWAP + MACD crossover + Bollinger lower band touch). Adjustable thresholds (e.g., RSI <30.0 by 0.1).
Exit Rules: Target % (e.g., +0.3-1.0%), trailing stop, or reversal signals (e.g., MACD divergence). Force exit at session end if open.
Semi/Full Auto: Toggle in settings; semi shows notifications/signals, full executes orders.
Leverage/Risk: Auto-calculate qty based on equity and max risk % (default 1%). Support up to 4x if PDT allows.

Indicators Implementation:
Calculate in real-time from streamed bars: EMA (period adjustable), VWAP (intraday reset), RSI, MACD, Bollinger, Stochastic. Overlay on chart with neon lines (green buy signals, red sell).

Notifications and Background:
Foreground Service: Run bot as foreground service (persistent notification icon). Show snippets in notification drawer: "JNJ: $151.23 | Mode: Short | Signal: Entry Ready".
Alerts: System notifications for entries/exits, market status (e.g., "Volatility high—pausing bot"). Use vibration/sound.

UI/Theme Details:
Cyberpunk-Matrix Hybrid: Black background with neon green/blue accents, glitch effects on animations (e.g., price updates flicker like code rain). Holographic buttons (3D glow), matrix font for prices. Dark mode only; subtle particle effects (e.g., digital rain on idle screens).
Nice Features: Gesture controls (swipe to switch symbols), voice commands for start/stop, customizable neon colors, achievement badges (e.g., "10-Win Streak" with confetti).

Performance/Security:
Optimize for low battery (throttle updates in background). Encrypt all saved data. Auto-logout after 30 min idle. Handle API rate limits with retries.


Build this exactly as specified, and NeoScalp will be a powerhouse—futuristic, user-friendly, and edge-giving for scalping. Test thoroughly on emulator/device before live trading.
